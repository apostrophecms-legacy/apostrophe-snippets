## NOT FOR NEW PROJECTS

This module is for the 0.5.x version of Apostrophe. In Apostrophe 2.x, `apostrophe-pieces` is a built-in Apostrophe module that provides very similar and greatly improved functionality (see the tutorials). This module will not work in a 2.x project and you do not need it.

# apostrophe-snippets

`apostrophe-snippets` adds a repository of reusable content snippets to the [Apostrophe](http://apostrophenow.org) content management system. Snippets can also be subclassed to implement new content types.

[Please see the Apostrophe documentation](http://apostrophenow.org/tutorials/snippets) for complete information.
